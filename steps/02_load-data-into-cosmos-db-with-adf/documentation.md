# Load Data Into Cosmos DB with ADF

In this lab, you will populate an Azure Cosmos DB container from an existing set of data using tools built in to Azure. After importing, you will use the Azure portal to view your imported data.

> If you have not already completed setup for the lab content see the instructions for [Account Setup](00-account_setup.md) before starting this lab.  This will create an Azure Cosmos DB database and container that you will use throughout the lab. You will also use an **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** resource to import existing data into your container.

## Create Azure Cosmos DB Database and Container

You will now create a database and container within your Azure Cosmos DB account.

1. Navigate to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)

1. On the left side of the portal, select the **Resource groups** link.

    ![Resource groups is highlighted](./assets/03-resource_groups.jpg "Select the Resource Groups")

1. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the **cosmoslabs** resource group.

    ![The cosmoslabs resource group is highlighted](./assets/03-lab_resource_group.jpg "Select the cosmoslabs resource group")

1. In the **cosmoslabs** blade, select the **Azure Cosmos DB** account you recently created.

    ![The Cosmos DB resource is highlighted](./assets/03-cosmos_resource.jpg "Select the cosmoslabs resource")

1. In the **Azure Cosmos DB** blade, locate and select the **Overview** link on the left side of the blade. At the top select the **Add Container** button.

    ![Add container link is highlighted](./assets/03-add_collection.jpg "Add a new container")

1. In the **Add Container** popup, perform the following actions:

    1. In the **Database id** field, select the **Create new** option and enter the value **NutritionDatabase**.

    2. Do not check the **Provision database throughput** option.

        > Provisioning throughput for a database allows you to share the throughput among all the containers that belong to that database. Within an Azure Cosmos DB database, you can have a set of containers which shares the throughput as well as containers, which have dedicated throughput.

    3. In the **Container Id** field, enter the value **FoodCollection**.

    4. In the **Partition key** field, enter the value ``/foodGroup``.

    5. In the **Throughput** field, enter the value ``11000``. *Note: we will reduce this to 400 RU/s after the data has been imported*

    6. Select the **OK** button.

1. Wait for the creation of the new **database** and **container** to finish before moving on with this lab.

## Import Lab Data Into Container

You will use **Azure Data Factory (ADF)** to import the JSON array stored in the **nutrition.json** file from Azure Blob Storage.


1. On the left side of the portal, select the **Resource groups** link.

    > To learn more about copying data to Cosmos DB with ADF, please read [ADF's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-factory/connector-azure-cosmos-db).

    ![Resource groups link is highlighted](./assets/03-resource_groups.jpg "Select Resource Groups")

1. In the **Resource groups** blade, locate and select the Cloud Academy resource group containing the lab resources.
